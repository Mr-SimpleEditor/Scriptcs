scriptcs is for running c# program in Linux
because it is not avaiable for linux i have created this for Linux users

In Linux mono is used to run the C# program, but everytime we run we have to create it's .exe file and then execute it.
So to save this time i've created this scriptcs which contains the mono commands so it is automated program

 
Steps to install :

This command will install important packages and setup your scriptcs
 
1. sudo bash install.sh

Now you are ready to rock!


syntax : 

 scriptcs <File.cs>



If caught any error please let me know.
