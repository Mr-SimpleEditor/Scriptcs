## Welcome to the Scriptcs wiki!


  scriptcs is for running c# program in Linux because it is not avaiable for linux i have created this for Linux users

               
####                          In Linux [mono](https://www.mono-project.com/) is used to run the C# program, but everytime we run we have to create it's .exe file and then execute it. So to save this time i've created this scriptcs which contains the mono commands so it is automated program


**Steps to install :**


    `cd Scriptcs`

    `sudo bash install.sh`


Now you are ready to rock!


syntax :

   `scriptcs <File.cs>`


If got some error first try to use the scriptcs through above syntax or if scriptcs is still visible in the Scriptcs dir then only it is failed otherwise it might be installed and moved on `/bin/`.

If faced any other errors please let me know.
